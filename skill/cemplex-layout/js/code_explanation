This is a brief explanation of how the chartjs code works and how to change what aspects.

const ctx = document.getElementById('js--chart1');

  new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
      labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
      datasets: [{
        label: '# of Votes',
        data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
        borderWidth: 1
      }]
    },
    options: {
      scales: {
        y: {
          beginAtZero: true
        }
      }
    }
  });


Line 3: Refers to the canvas. So we make a variable that refers to the canvas we want, in this case the canvas with id="js--chart1".
line 5: makes a new object
line 6: type refers to the kind of chart you want, to experiment you can try and change 'bar' to 'line'
line 7-14: the information like the amount or the things that are in the graph
line 8: x as of the graph, the particular cases rather the measurement of the case
line 9-13: data assets, stuff that determines the line and stuff
line 10: the thing that is measured
line 11: the amount
line 12: the width of the border
line 15: adds an X as and Y as
